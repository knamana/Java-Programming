# Problem Statement

### Write a program which reads the input n from the user to generate the reversed Pascals triangle with n rows. Note that you need to take the triangle alignment into consideration.

# Output1:

Enter number of rows to display inverted pascal triangle: 6
       1   5  10  10   5   1
         1   4   6   4   1
           1   3   3   1
             1   2   1
               1   1
                 1

# Output2:

Enter number of rows to display inverted pascal triangle: 4
       1   3   3   1
         1   2   1
           1   1
             1

# Output3:

Enter number of rows to display inverted pascal triangle: 0
